    q is a seaice instance; years is a list of years (integers); the band depth is computed using Nforecasts. For 'method' see the documentation of statsmodels.graphics.functional.banddepth; alternatives are 'MBD' (newer, less sensitive to ties) or 'BD2' (the original LÃ³pez-Pintado & Romo definition)
    Returns a list of years, and a list of matchning scores. The returned years may be a subset of the input list of years, because a data hole may make the forecast impossible for some years.
    Defaults to making 150 days long forecasts starting on June 1st.
    Defaults on using initial perturbations that are 1/2 of the median nearest neighbor distance."""
